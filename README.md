This repository demonstrates a Python function that may throw a ZeroDivisionError despite a conditional check for zero. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` divides `b` by `a`.  The condition `if a == 0:` checks for zero and seems to prevent division by zero. However, it only prevents the error when `a` is zero and does not handle the potential error when `b` is zero and `a` is not. This showcases a subtle error that is easy to overlook. The solution involves adding an additional condition to check for `b` being zero or using a `try-except` block to gracefully handle the exception.
